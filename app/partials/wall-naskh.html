<strong>Naskh</strong>, which means "copying" in Arabic, was developed in the 10th century, and refined into a fine
art form in Turkey in the 16th century. Since then it became generally accepted for writing the Koran.
Naskh is legible and clear and was adapted as the preferred style for typesetting and printing.
It is a small script whose lines are thin and letter shapes are round.
