The <strong>Diwani</strong> script is a cursive style of calligraphy developed during the reign of the early Ottoman
Turks (16th-early 17th century). It was invented by Housam Roumi and reached its height of popularity
under SÃ¼leyman I the Magnificent (1520-66). As decorative as it was communicative, Diwani was
distinguished by the complexity of the line within the letter and the close juxtaposition of the
letters within the word.
