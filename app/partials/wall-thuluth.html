<strong>Thuluth</strong> was the medieval Islamic style of handwritten alphabet. Thuluth (Arabic: ثلث or "one-third") is written on
the principle that one-third of each letter slopes. It is a large and elegant, cursive script, used in medieval
times on mosque decorations. It took on some of the functions of the early Kufi script; it was used to write Surah
headings, religious inscriptions, and princely titles and epigraphs. It was also used for many of the large copies
of the Koran produced from the 13th century.
