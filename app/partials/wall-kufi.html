The <strong>Kufi</strong> script, a heavy monumental Arabic script suited to stone carving, appears in the earliest
surviving Koran manuscripts. In these, the diacritical marks over the letters are sometimes painted in red,
and the gold decorations between Surahs contrast handsomely with the heavy black script. In the Seljuk period,
a more cursive flowing script, Naskh, developed. The two styles were often used for contrast in architecture
and decorative contexts.
